## Introduction

This repo is a **barebone minimalistic** starter-kit for TypeScript-based ExpressJS (https://expressjs.com/) app.

## Simplicity

In order to build and run the app, you have to execute only 2 NPM script commands.

## Dependencies

* ExpressJS
* ExpressJS Middlewares
    * Compression - https://github.com/expressjs/compression
    * Helmet - https://helmetjs.github.io/
* TypeScript
* NPM (or) Yarn

## Install, Build, Run

Install node package dependencies:

`$ npm install`

Build:

`$ npm run build`

Run ExpressJS server:

`$ npm start`

## Recommendation

Keep all TypeScript source files in the `src` folder.

## Future Goals

* Add more sample code like Routes, Controllers, and Views
* Add Webpack
* Add unit-test sample code for Jest
